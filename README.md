The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations

## Notes

Some challenges I encountered were I think specifically because I have a different version of XCode on my laptop (version 7) than the video:
  1) I had issues connecting Sent Events (Value Changed to calculateTip function) and had to look to Stackoverflow for help
  2) Had issues with "Any" and "AnyObject" when creating a function
  3) Had to look up a different way to connect GitHub than what was given in video
  4) Just some general issues finding certain tools that were located differently on my XCode version than the version used in the video
